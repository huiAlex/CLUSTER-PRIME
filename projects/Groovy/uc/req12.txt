[GROOVY-5263] New GDK method: Object[].contains() [GROOVY-5273] Provide contains as a DGM method for primitive arrays  <p>We treat arrays as Lists in may respects. There are methods from List that have been grafted unto arrays however there is no <tt>contains()</tt> method which would come in handy in scenarios like the following one</p>

<div class= code panel  style= border-width: 1px; ><div class= codeContent panelContent >
<pre class= code-java ><span class= code-keyword >if</span>(!arrayOfObjects.contains(element)) {
    arrayOfObjects &lt;&lt; elements
}
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>One way to do it currently is this</p>

<div class= code panel  style= border-width: 1px; ><div class= codeContent panelContent >
<pre class= code-java ><span class= code-keyword >if</span>( !(element in arrayOfObjects) ) {
    arrayOfObjects &lt;&lt; elements
}
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>Notice the additional () around the expression</p> <p>There is already count(...), size() and other methods for primitive arrays but no contains.<br/>
There is an isCase() method but Java programmers are more familiar with contains so we should provide for that approach too.</p>
