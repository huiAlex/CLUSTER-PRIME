[GROOVY-260] Thread.start { } to execute a closure in a new thread <p>hi,</p>

<p>I talked to james and he liked the idea of adding a simple Thread.start(Closure c) so that you can easily run things in new threads.</p>

<p>example:</p>

<p>thread = Thread.start {<br/>
  process =  some long running process .execute();<br/>
  process.waitFor();<br/>
}</p>

<p>.. do something else while this runs.</p>
