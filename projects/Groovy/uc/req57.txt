[GROOVY-3307] Add byte[].encodeHex <p>Groovy provides a very convenient encodeBase64 method in byte[]. It would be even more convenient if there were also an encodeHex method in byte[]. See</p>

<p>The Apache Commons Codec project provides an implementation of a hex encoder but it would also be trivial to implement from scratch. This feature would be immensely convenient when working with checksums.</p>
