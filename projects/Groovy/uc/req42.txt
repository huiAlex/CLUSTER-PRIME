[GROOVY-2471] Add newInputStream and withInputStream to java.net.URL for dealing with binary files <p>I recently came across a situation where I wanted to initialize a JCE Certificate directly from a URL. I wanted to do this:</p>

<div class= code panel  style= border-width: 1px; ><div class= codeContent panelContent >
<pre class= code-java >def cfUrl = args[0].toURL()
def cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance(<span class= code-quote > X.509 </span>)
def newRootCert = cfUrl.withInputStream { cf.generateCertificate(it) }
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>Putting aside the fact that the with* methods don t return the closure return value (which I m going to create a separate JIRA for), there is not currently a withInputStream method for URL.</p>

<p>I could do something like this to work around it, but I d rather do it the Groovier way:</p>

<div class= code panel  style= border-width: 1px; ><div class= codeContent panelContent >
<pre class= code-java >def newRootCert = cfUrl.openStream().withStream { cf.generateCertificate(it) }
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>I ve attached a patch to add URL.newInputStream and URL.withInputStream. It doesn t have any tests because I couldn t find any existing tests for URL.withReader (or File.withInputStream for that matter) and wasn t sure what the best way to handle it would be.</p>
