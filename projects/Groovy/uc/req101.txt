[GROOVY-5392] @ASTTest AST transformation <p>When we develop AST transformations, it is often difficult to check that a particular transformation performs what is necessary. For example, we would like, in type checking, to verify that after the type checker has performed its work, a particular AST node contains metadata about the inferred type. Checking this currently requires compilation trickery which is not user-friendly. We propose to add an AST transformation which allows embedding tests. For example, we could test the <tt>@Field</tt> AST transformation this way:</p>

<div class= code panel  style= border-width: 1px; ><div class= codeContent panelContent >
<pre class= code-java ><span class= code-keyword >import</span> groovy.transform.*

@ASTTest(value = {
    def owner = node.declaringClass
    <span class= code-keyword >assert</span> owner.fields.any { it.name ==  x  }
}
@Field <span class= code-object >int</span> x
</pre>
</div></div>
