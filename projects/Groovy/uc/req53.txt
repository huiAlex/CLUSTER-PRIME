[GROOVY-3106] Provide a split(closure) DGM method on collections <p>Based on mailing list feedback it seems like <tt>split()</tt> is worthwhile but <tt>partition()</tt> can almost as easily be replicated using <tt>groupBy</tt> so maybe not worth it.</p>

<p>The functionality is the same as <tt>findAll()</tt> but returns both the accepted and rejected elements in two lists.</p>
