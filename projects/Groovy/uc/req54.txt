[GROOVY-315] Ability to create static groovy methods <p>Currently, it s only possible to create instance groovy methods.<br/>
Such as <br/>
file = new File( text.txt )<br/>
file.eachLine</p>
{ line | println it }
<p>But we cannot currently add static methods, such as (<a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-260  title= Thread.start { } to execute a closure in a new thread  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= GROOVY-260 ><del>GROOVY-260</del></a>):<br/>
thread = Thread.start { <br/>
  process =  some long running process .execute(); <br/>
  process.waitFor(); <br/>
}</p>
