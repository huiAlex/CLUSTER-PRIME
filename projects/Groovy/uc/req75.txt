[GROOVY-4174] Support for String translation similar to unix  tr  command <p>Unix has a  tr  translation command. It would be good for Groovy to support something similar.<br/>
Translations similar to what  tr  does can be achieved using regular expressions but the<br/>
notation required is much more compact and the implementation can be much more efficient. </p>
