[GROOVY-1508] Add option -a <splitpattern> to allow auto split of lines read when using command-line scripts (via -e) <p>When writing one-liners in other scripting languages it is very helpful sometimes to automatically have access to an array containing the current line split according to a pattern. This patch adds a commandline option -a that implements this. It takes on optional parameter, the split pattern. If not used, the split pattern is     (a single space).</p>

<p>The patched file is GroovyMain.java</p>
