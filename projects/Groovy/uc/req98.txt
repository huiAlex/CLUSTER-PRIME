<div class= code panel  style= border-width: 1px; ><div class= codeContent panelContent >
<pre class= code-java >@Immutable class Person {
  <span class= code-object >String</span> name
  @KnownImmutable MyUuid id
}

@KnownImmutables([MyDate, MyUuid])
@Immutable class Person {
  <span class= code-object >String</span> name
