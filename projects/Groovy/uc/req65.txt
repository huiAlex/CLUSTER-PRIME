[GROOVY-3652] Enhance Swing classes and models with additional methods <p>Some swing models do not follow a naming standard for common operations like get(int), set(int,element), clear() nor they provide an iterator() method (for those that make sense). This is a request to enhance Swing classes and models with additional methods that bridge the gap with useful collection/groovy methods.</p>
