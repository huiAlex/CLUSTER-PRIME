[JBRULES-1942] Adding API method that returns a collection of WorkingMemoryEntryPoints <p>Currently there exists the method getWorkingMemoryEntryPoint(String) - that will return the named entry point.<br/>
There is not an API call exposed to allow the collection of entry points to be gathered. Such as  Collection&lt;WorkingMemoryEntryPoint&gt; getWorkingMemoryEntryPoints()</p>

<p>This would be useful in many ways to allow developers to maintain entry points and list those points for further use (IE a gui that tests rules by allowing the selection of which entry point an event enters)</p>

<p>Otherwise the developer is forced to hold and sync this information outside the drools code, which is both messy and prone to bugs and faults.<br/>
A typical way would be to hold a list of entry points at their creation and hope that no other code removes the entry point without updating the list.</p>

<p>Discussed with e tirelli on IRC.</p>
