[JBRULES-2120] Dynamic or Ah-Hoc node <p>An ad-hoc or dynamic node acts as a node container where not all nodes are cleanly connected to each other but they are modeled as separate fragments that are not necessarily linked to each other.  By default, all nodes that do not have an incoming connection would be triggered when the dynamic node is triggered, and the node will wait until all node instances have been completed before continuing.  Different strategies could also allow:</p>
<ul class= alternate  type= square >
	<li>(rule or code) constriants that define when certain fragments should be activated</li>
	<li>the user can add additional node instances at runtime, even though they are not modeled as part of the process, and the node will wait until they are completed as well</li>
</ul>
