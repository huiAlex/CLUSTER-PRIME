[JBRULES-325] Compiler speedup: pass ClassName[] to JCI for bulk compiling <p>JDT and other compilers work best when you throw a whole lot of source at them, not dribble it though.</p>

<p>We can refactor PackageBuilder to build up a set of classes to compile and pass it to JCI at the last minute - the only trick is to map errors back from whence they came. This yields a 4X speed up in many cases.</p>
