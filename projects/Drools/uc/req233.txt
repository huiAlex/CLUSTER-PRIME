[JBRULES-3157] Add information such as line number or source code in VerifierComponent <p>We can link the VerifierComponent with their descriptions.<br/>
This provides a simple access to information from the descriptions of the component or its associated VerifierMessageBase.</p>

<p>I tested this by adding to the VerifierComponent  constructor the BaseDescr :<br/>
public abstract class VerifierComponent implements Comparable&lt;VerifierComponent&gt;, Cause {<br/>
    private BaseDescr descr;<br/>
    public VerifierComponent(BaseDescr descr) </p>
{
        this.descr = descr;
    }
<p>...<br/>
}</p>

<p>And integrate that in all Visitors.<br/>
This seems to work. ( <a href= https://github.com/jerr/drools/tree/line-number-in-verifier  class= external-link  rel= nofollow >https://github.com/jerr/drools/tree/line-number-in-verifier</a> )</p>

<p>What do you think of this, I can add test cases and provide a patch or git pull request.</p>
