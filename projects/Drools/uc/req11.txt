[JBRULES-874] Allow direct property access to pattern bound variables [JBRULES-315] Support to Expression and Nested Accessors  <p>Allow the usage of direct property access for pattern bound variables. Example:</p>

<p>rule  test auto bindings 1 <br/>
when<br/>
	$p : Person();<br/>
	$c : Cheese( type == $p.likes, price == $c.price  )<br/>
then<br/>
    results.add( $p );<br/>
end</p>
 <p>Would be nice to have a feature like:</p>


<p>Map(this.foo == bar)  as being accessed as: map.get( foo )</p>

<p>This can work as in the ClassFieldInspector it can tell that there is no  getFoo  method, but there is a get(xxx) method - hence it can pass in the key as the field name (as a string).</p>

<p>A limitation may be that we want to use a prev bound variable as a key, but I can t see how that will work short of adding new syntax (this currently stays within the current grammar which is good - and looking up fields via a String key is more then useful !).</p>
