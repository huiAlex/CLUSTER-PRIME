[JBRULES-61] XML bindings <p>We need to support XML bindings for the Descr classes.</p>

<p>XMLBeans or similar etc. The idea is to provide some XML support for those who need to use XML authoring, or generating tools, and also provide a  native  Drools XML format for use with XSLT for RuleML, OWL etc.... Should be 1 to 1 with the Descr AST classes mostly. </p>
