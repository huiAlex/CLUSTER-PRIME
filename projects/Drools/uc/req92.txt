[JBRULES-144] async assert <p>We need an async assert. This means the fact is is asserted and immediately returns. Internally there is a consumer/provider based queue that one by one asserts the stacked items into the working memory. Need ot make sure that users can handle async exceptions.</p>

<p>There might also be some settings to do with 2 phase commit, in that when do we call fireAllRules? Do we call it after every assertion, after a set time period, after X facts are asserted - or maybe a combination of both? Initially probably esiest to just call fireAllRules on each assertion from the Queue.</p>

<p>I recommend that thechannel code stuff be  borrowed  from <a href= http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/util/concurrent/LinkedQueue.html  class= external-link  rel= nofollow >http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/util/concurrent/LinkedQueue.html</a> - only take hte classes you need and refactor them for org.drools.util.concurrent.</p>
