[JBRULES-546] Please implement  collect( ... ) from  functionality <p>I need to count the number of sub-objects that meet various criteria.  As an example, suppose I have several hundred Town objects, each of which has a list of perhaps a few hundred Person objects.  I need to write rules like:</p>

<p> Find all the towns that have more than three disabled people with incomes over $100K. <br/>
 For each town with more than 1000 residents that has more than 50 poor children under the age of 8, add a teacher for every 25 children. </p>

<p>I m shaky on JBR syntax, but I think those would translate to something like:</p>

<p>rule  disabled <br/>
  when<br/>
    ArrayList(size &gt; 50) from collect( Person( disabled ==  yes , income &gt; 100000 ) from town.getPersons() )<br/>
  then<br/>
    //do stuff<br/>
end</p>

<p>rule  teachers <br/>
  when<br/>
    town : Town( population &gt; 1000 )<br/>
    count : Arraylist from collect( Person( disabled ==  yes , income &gt; 100000 ) from town.getPersons() )<br/>
    count( size &gt; 50 )<br/>
  then<br/>
    town.addTeachers(count.size() / 25)<br/>
end</p>

<p>(I m not really working with towns and people, but it makes for easily understood examples)</p>
