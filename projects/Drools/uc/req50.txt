[DROOLS-99] TypeDeclarations for Java classes used in Patterns are created in the wrong package <p>when a rule uses a java class in a pattern:</p>

<p>package my.test;<br/>
import org.drools.Cheese;<br/>
rule R when Cheese() then end</p>

<p>a TypeDeclaration for that class (e.g.Cheese) is created, but is assigned<br/>
to the rule package ( my.test ) rather than to the natural class package<br/>
( org.drools ). This prevents an efficient later lookup of the typeDeclaration<br/>
using the class name as a key.</p>
