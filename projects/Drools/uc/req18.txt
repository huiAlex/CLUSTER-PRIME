[JBRULES-2049] org.drools.runtime.rule StatefulRuleSession.fireAllRules(org.drools.runtime.rule.AgendaFilter af) has no AgendaFilter implementations [JBRULES-2883] Expose org.drools.runtime.rule StatefulRuleSession. fireAllRules(org.drools.runtime.rule. AgendaFilter agendaFilter, int fireLimit)  <p>StatefulSession.fireAllRules(org.drools.spi.AgendaFilter af) has several implementations of AgendaFilter for filtering rules. Why aren t the AgendaFilters common? Even the Activation class between them is different, so it is not simple to workaround by wrapping org.drools.spi.AgendaFilter impls. It would be handy if there were out-of-the-box AgendaFilters for implementations of StatefulRuleSession.</p> <p>fireAllRules(AgendaFilter agendaFilter, int fireLimit) is exposed in org.drools. StatefulSession class. StatefulSession extends WorkingMemory which has the above API.</p>

<p>We look for the same function in org.drools.runtime.StatefulKnowledgeSession class.  StatefulKnowledgeSession extends org.drools.runtime.rule. StatefulRuleSession which doesn t have method fireAllRules(org.drools.runtime.rule. AgendaFilter agendaFilter, int fireLimit). We would like to have  the API added so we can switch from the rule base to the knowledge base. </p>
