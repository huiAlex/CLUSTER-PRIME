[PIG-1794] Javascript support for Pig embedding and UDFs in scripting languages <p>The attached patch proposes a javascript implementation for Pig embedding and UDFs in scripting languages.<br/>
It is similar to the Jython implementation and uses Rhino provided in the JDK.<br/>
some differences:</p>
<ul class= alternate  type= square >
	<li>output schema is provided by: &lt;functionName&gt;.outSchema= &lt;schema&gt;  as javascript does not have annotations or decorators but functions are first class objects</li>
	<li>tuples are converted to objects using the input schema (the other way around using the output schema)</li>
</ul>


<p>The attached patch is not final yet. In particular it lacks unit tests.<br/>
See test/org/apache/pig/test/data/tc.js for the  transitive closure  example</p>
