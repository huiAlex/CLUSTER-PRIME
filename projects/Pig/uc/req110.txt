[PIG-741] Add LIMIT as a statement that works in nested FOREACH <p>I d like to compute the top 10 results in each group.</p>

<p>The natural way to express this in Pig would be:</p>

<div class= code panel  style= border-width: 1px; ><div class= codeContent panelContent >
<pre class= code-java >
A = load  ...  using PigStorage() as (
    date: <span class= code-object >int</span>,
    count: <span class= code-object >int</span>,
    url: chararray
);

B = group A by ( date );

C = foreach B {
    D = order A by count desc;
    E = limit D 10;
    generate
        FLATTEN(E);
    };

dump C;
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>Yeah, I could write a UDF / PiggyBank function to take the top n results. But since LIMIT already exists as a statement, it seems like it should also work in the nested foreach context.</p>

<p>Example workaround code.</p>

<div class= code panel  style= border-width: 1px; ><div class= codeContent panelContent >
<pre class= code-java >
C = foreach B {
    D = order A by count desc;
    E = util.TOP(D, 10);
    generate
        FLATTEN(E);
    };

dump C;
</pre>
</div></div>
