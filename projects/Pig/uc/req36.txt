[PIG-1461] support union operation that merges based on column names <p>When the data has schema, it often makes sense to union on column names in schema rather than the position of the columns. <br/>
The behavior of existing union operator should remain backward compatible .</p>

<p>This feature can be supported using either a new operator or extending union to support  using  clause . I am thinking of having a new operator called either unionschema or merge . Does anybody have any other suggestions for the syntax ?</p>

<p>example -</p>

<p>L1 = load  x  as (a,b);<br/>
L2 = load  y  as (b,c);<br/>
U = unionschema L1, L2;</p>

<p>describe U;<br/>
U: </p>
{a:bytearray, b:byetarray, c:bytearray}
