[PIG-626] Statistics (records read by each mapper and reducer) <p>This uses the counters framework that hadoop has. Initially, I am just interested in finding out the number of records read by each mapper/reducer particularly for the last job in any script. A sample code to access the statistics for the last job:</p>

<p>String reducePlan = stats.getPigStats().get(stats.getLastJobID()).get( PIG_STATS_REDUCE_PLAN );<br/>
        if(reducePlan == null) </p>
{
            System.out.println( Records written :   + stats.getPigStats().get(stats.getLastJobID()).get( PIG_STATS_MAP_OUTPUT_RECORDS ));
        }
<p> else </p>
{
            System.out.println( Records written :   + stats.getPigStats().get(stats.getLastJobID()).get( PIG_STATS_REDUCE_OUTPUT_RECORDS ));
        }
<p>The patch contains 7 test cases. These include tests PigStorage and BinStorage along with one for multiple MR jobs case.</p>
