[PIG-4141] Ship UDF/LoadFunc/StoreFunc dependent jar automatically <p>When user use AvroStorage/JsonStorage/OrcStorage, they need to register dependent jars manually. It would be much convenient if we can provide a mechanism for UDF/LoadFunc/StoreFunc to claim the dependency and ship jars automatically.</p>
