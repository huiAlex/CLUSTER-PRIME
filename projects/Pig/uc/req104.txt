[PIG-4796] Authenticate with Kerberos using a keytab file <p>When running in a Kerberos secured environment users are faced with the limitation that their jobs cannot run longer than the (remaining) ticket lifetime of their Kerberos tickets. The environment I work in these tickets expire after 10 hours, thus limiting the maximum job duration to at most 10 hours (which is a problem).</p>

<p>In the Hadoop tooling there is a feature where you can authenticate using a Kerberos keytab file (essentially a file that contains the encrypted form of the kerberos principal and password). Using this the running application can request new tickets from the Kerberos server when the initial tickets expire.</p>

<p>In my Java/Hadoop applications I commonly include these two lines:</p>
<div class= code panel  style= border-width: 1px; ><div class= codeContent panelContent >
<pre class= code-java >
<span class= code-object >System</span>.setProperty(<span class= code-quote > java.security.krb5.conf </span>, <span class= code-quote > /etc/krb5.conf </span>);
UserGroupInformation.loginUserFromKeytab(<span class= code-quote > nbasjes@XXXXXX.NET </span>, <span class= code-quote > /home/nbasjes/.krb/nbasjes.keytab </span>);
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>This way I have run an Apache Flink based application for more than 170 hours (about a week) on the kerberos secured Yarn cluster.</p>

<p>What I propose is to have a feature that I can set the relevant kerberos values in my pig script and from there be able to run a pig job for many days on the secured cluster.</p>

<p>Proposal how this can look in a pig script:</p>
<div class= code panel  style= border-width: 1px; ><div class= codeContent panelContent >
<pre class= code-java >
SET java.security.krb5.conf  /etc/krb5.conf 
SET job.security.krb5.principal  nbasjes@XXXXXX.NET 
SET job.security.krb5.keytab  /home/nbasjes/.krb/nbasjes.keytab 
</pre>
</div></div>
<p>So iff all of these are set (or at least the last two) then the aforementioned  UserGroupInformation.loginUserFromKeytab method is called before submitting the job to the cluster.</p>
