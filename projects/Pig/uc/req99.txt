[PIG-4370] HBaseStorage should support delete markers <p>We have a case where writing  deletes  to HBase would be very useful in Pig. There is a precedent for delete operations - <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-5867  class= external-link  rel= nofollow >https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-5867</a><br/>
so I think it s a valid use case for Pig especially considering that in HBase a delete is really a write of a tombstone marker</p>
