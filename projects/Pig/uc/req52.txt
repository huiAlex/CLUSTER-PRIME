[PIG-2293] Pig should support a more efficient merge join against data sources that natively support point lookups or where the join is against large, sparse tables. <p>The existing PIG merge join has the following limitations:<br/>
   1. It assumes the right side of the table must be accessed sequentially - record by record.<br/>
   2. It does not perform well against large, sparse tables.</p>

<p>The current implementation of the merge join introduced the interface IndexableLoadFunc.  This  LoadFunc <br/>
supports the ability to  seekNear  a given key (before reading the next record).  <br/>
The merge join physical operator only calls  seekNear  for the first key in each split (effectively eliminating splits<br/>
where the first and subsequent keys will not be found).  Subsequent joins are found by reading sequentially through<br/>
the records on the right table looking for matches from the left table.</p>

<p>While this method works well for dense join tables - it performs poorly against large sparse tables or data sources that support <br/>
point lookups natively (HBase for example).</p>

<p>The proposed enhancement is to add a new join type -  merge-sparse  to PIG latin.  When specified in the PIG script, this join type<br/>
will cause the merge join operator to call seekNear on each and every key (rather than just the first in each split).</p>
