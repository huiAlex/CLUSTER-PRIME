[PIG-1510] Add `deepCopy` for LogicalExpressions  <p>It would be useful to have a way to `deepCopy` an expression. `deepCopy` will create a new object so that changes made to one object will not reflect in the copy. There are 2 reasons why we don t override clone.</p>
<ul>
	<li>It may be better to use `deepCopy` since the copy semantics are explicit (since deepCopy may be expensive).</li>
	<li>A second important reason for defining `deepCopy` as a separate routine is that it can be passed a plan as an argument which will be updated as the expression is copied (through plan.add and plan.connect).</li>
</ul>


<p>The usage would look like the following:</p>
<div class= preformatted panel  style= border-width: 1px; ><div class= preformattedContent panelContent >
<pre>LogicalExpressionPlan logicalPlan = new LogicalExpressionPlan();
LogicalExpression copyExpression = origExpression.deepCopy( logicalPlan );
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>An immediate motivation for this would be for constructing the expressions that constitute the CNF form of an expression.</p>
