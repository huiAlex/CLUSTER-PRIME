[PIG-2548] Support for providing parameters to python script <p>If I have an embedded pig script in python, there is no way to get user passed parameters in the python script.<br/>
Though <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-2165  title= Need a way to deal with params and param_file in embedded pig in python  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= PIG-2165 ><del>PIG-2165</del></a> adds the capability of reading these params in the pig script, from python it is still not possible.<br/>
It would be nice to have this feature if I have some sort of post processing happening in my python scrip based on the params.</p>
