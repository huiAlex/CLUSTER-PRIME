[PIG-3090] Introduce a syntax to be able to easily refer to the previously defined relation <p>Sometimes I feel like swimming with ANTLRs. This particular feature isn t too hard to add... and supports syntax like this:</p>

<div class= code panel  style= border-width: 1px; ><div class= codeContent panelContent >
<pre class= code-java >
a = load  thing  as (x:<span class= code-object >int</span>);
b = foreach @ generate x;
c = foreach @ generate x;
d = foreach @ generate x;
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>I have a patch, though I need to make sure it doesn t change anything (it shouldn t) and I need to add tests.</p>
