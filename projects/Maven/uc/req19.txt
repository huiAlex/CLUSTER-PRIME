[MNG-5230] Command line option to exclude modules from reactor  <p>Every now and then I want to exclude one or more modules from a rather large reactor build.<br/>
One reason for this can be: The respective module has tests that take long time to execute and I know that I don t need to execute them.</p>

<p>Introducing yet another profile for this is not desirable for various reasons.</p>

<p>So, something like an opposite to -pl would come in handy. Let s say  -el  for  exclude list .</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<div class= code panel  style= border-width: 1px; ><div class= codeContent panelContent >
<pre class= code-java >root
  + module a
    + module a1
    + module a2
  + module b
    + module b1
  + module c
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>Calling <em>mvn -el a1,c</em> would build all modules execpt a1 and c.</p>
