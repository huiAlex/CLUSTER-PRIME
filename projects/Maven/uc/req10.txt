[MNG-4381] Allow extension plugins to contribute non-core components to be reused by other plugins  <p>In Maven 2.x, build extensions can only contribute components that realize a custom impl of some API defined by the Maven core like artifact handlers and lifecycle mappings. However, to support things like Tycho in a stock Maven distro, we need a build extension to provide components that<br/>
a) realize APIs defined merely by the extension and are unknown to Maven itself<br/>
b) can be looked up and accessed via API from the extension and other plugins in the same project<br/>
c) can be shared among all projects in the reactor using the same extension, including state kept by singletons</p>
