[JBSEAM-1414] Seam security - extending Identity class <p>I would like to extend org.jboss.seam.security.Identity class in order to integrate Seam with 3rd party libraries such as Acegi.</p>

<p>For this to work I need to overload the Identity subject. Since the subject attribute is private <b>and</b> Identity class access it always directly (doesn t use the getter) <b>and</b> there s no public or protected setter, I cannot override it.</p>

<p>Could Identity class me modified such as :<br/>
1. subject attribute is made protected OR<br/>
2. adding a protected setter attribute OR<br/>
3. <span class= error >&#91;better solution I think&#93;</span> always acceeding to subject attribut via its getter.</p>

<p>This issue is related with the post <a href= http://jboss.org/index.html?module=bb&amp;op=viewtopic&amp;t=110367  class= external-link  rel= nofollow >http://jboss.org/index.html?module=bb&amp;op=viewtopic&amp;t=110367</a></p>

<p>Thanks</p>
