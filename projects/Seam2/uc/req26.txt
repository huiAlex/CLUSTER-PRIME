[JBSEAM-633] remoting extension in handling exceptions on client side  <p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I don t really know what JIRA is by the way, so hopefully nobody is upset by this post. I first mailed Gavin but he told me I should put it in JIRA. </p>

<p>I currently work on a project which uses Seam Remoting directly and I didn t find a neat way in handling errors on the client side as Exceptions are not propagated to it. Therefore I changed Seam to transmit all exceptions which can be handled in the javascript part via another callback. E.g.:</p>

<p>Seam.Component.getInstance( userManager ).currentUser(function(user) {<br/>
alert( user:   + user);<br/>
},<br/>
function(ex) {<br/>
alert( exception occured:   + ex.getMessage());<br/>
});</p>

<p>As the exception handler is optional, the change would not brake any client code. If you are interested in the change, you can reach me at heinzbeinz AT googlemail.com</p>
