[JBSEAM-120] Allow use of @DataModel with an array or Map or Set <p>We already have an ArrayDataModel, let s let it be used with @DataModel.</p>

<p>We should also allow use of @DataModel with a Map. Essentially, this would result in a ListDataModel&lt;Map.Entry&gt;, but @DataModelSelectionIndex would know to inject the map key instead of the row index, and @DataModelSelection would know to inject the map value instead of the Map.Entry.</p>


<p>We should probably even allow use with a Set. In this case, @DataModelSelectionIndex is not defined.</p>
