[JBSEAM-3869] Check for problematic component definitions at deployment <p>Seam currently allows combinations such as:</p>

<p>@Stateless<br/>
@Name( NoConversationHere )<br/>
@Scope(ScopeType.CONVERSATION)</p>

<p>Which make no sense and can cause problems.  If possible, Seam (or Web Beans!) should check for such things and WARN/ERROR on deployment.</p>
