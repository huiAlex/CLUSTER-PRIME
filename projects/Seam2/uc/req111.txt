[JBSEAM-178] Cascading Message Bundles <p>Would it be possible to get the Seam i18n features to scan for multiple resource bundles, so that common resources can be shared across mutliple applications?</p>

<p>Here s a few ways this could be accomplished:<br/>
1) Rename the default bundle  messages.properties  to  seam-messages.properties , and scan for multiple seam-messages.properties in the EAR.</p>

<p>2) Add a new property name, or change the resourceBundle.bundleName property, to handle a delimited list of resourceBundles. So the default implementation uses a single bundle  messages.properties , but by adding a configuration property you can get it to scan multiple resource bundles in the order specified.</p>

<p>e.g.<br/>
resourceBundle.bundleName=Messages.properties,GlobalMessages.properties</p>

<p>3) Implement a cascading scheme, similar to the sample posted in the forum.</p>
