[JBSEAM-2469] add postback flag to page actions  <p>Page actions are incredibly useful, but sometimes they can get in the way during a postback. I would like to see a postback attribute added to the &lt;action&gt; tag that can be used to disable the action on postback. It s possible using a conditional, but it is ugly and a lot of typing.</p>

<p>Here is the logic that would go into Pages.java</p>

<p>    private boolean isPostBack(FacesContext facesContext)</p>
    {
        return facesContext.getExternalContext().getRequestParameterMap().
              containsKey(ResponseStateManager.VIEW_STATE_PARAM);
    }

<p>The conditional alternative would be:</p>

<p>&lt;action execute= #</p>
{component.action}
<p>  if= #</p>
{empty param[ javax.faces.ViewState ]}
<p> /&gt;</p>
