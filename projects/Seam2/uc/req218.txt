[JBSEAM-3664] change the priority of PermissionResolvers <p>If the Jpa Permission Store is used and a rule-based-permission-resolver and a persistent-permission-resolver is configured, the order for looking up permissions is:</p>

<p>1) DroolsFile, 2)persistent-permission-resolver 3) Other permission-resolvers what implments the permission-resolver interface</p>

<p>It would be nice if it s possible to change the order for looking up the permissions</p>
