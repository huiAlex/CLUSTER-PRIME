[JBSEAM-286] SeamTest - Add support for authenticated user <p>Add a property of type Principal and another property (maybe of type Group []?) to Script.  The Principal should be used by the MockHttpServletRequest to represent and authenticated user.  The Group [] property should be used by the MockHttpServletRequest to support the isUserInRole() implementation.</p>

<p>These properties ideally should be settable by overriding the setup() method of Script.</p>
