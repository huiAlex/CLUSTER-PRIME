[JBSEAM-790] Create a universal SeamFilter <p>In an average Seam application we may use some or all of the following filters, which may grow to even more over time:</p>

<p>SeamRedirectFilter<br/>
SeamExceptionFilter<br/>
SeamMultipartFilter<br/>
SeamServletFilter</p>

<p>It would be nice to be able to configure a single master filter, SeamFilter, which wraps all of these filters.  We could possibly even make each of these filters application-scoped components, meaning they could be configured via components.xml instead of in web.xml.</p>
