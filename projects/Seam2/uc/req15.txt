[JBSEAM-1342] Generic Scanner usability  <p>In our project we would like to use the JBoss Seam Scanner class to browse over our EJB classes in search for our custom @Config annotations (see <a href= http://cup-of-java.blogspot.com/  class= external-link  rel= nofollow >http://cup-of-java.blogspot.com/</a>). Unfortunately the handleItem method on the Scanner class is only package visible. This prevents generic reusability of this really powerful Scanner class. Could you guys make the handleItem method public?</p>

<p>Thanks,<br/>
Frank.</p>
