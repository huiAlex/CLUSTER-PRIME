[DERBY-239] Need a online backup feature  that does not block update operations   when online backup is in progress.  <p>Currently Derby allows users to perfoms  online backups using SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE() procedure,  but while the backup is in progress, update operations are temporarily blocked, but read operations can still proceed.</p>

<p>Blocking update operations can be real issue specifically in client server environments, because user requests will be blocked for a long time if a <br/>
backup is in the progress on the server.</p>
