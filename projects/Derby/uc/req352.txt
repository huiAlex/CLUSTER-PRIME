[DERBY-3790] Investigate if request for update statistics can be skipped for certain kind of indexes, one instance may be unique indexes based on one column. <p><a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-269  title= Provide some way to update index cardinality statistics (e.g. reimplement update statistics)  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-269 ><del>DERBY-269</del></a> provided a manual way to update the statisitcs. There was some discussion in that jira entry for possibly optimizing the cases where there is no need to update the statistics. I will enter the related comments from that jira entry here for reference.</p>

If I have understood correctly, unique indexes always have up to date cardinality statistics because cardinality == row count. If that s the case, one possible optimization is to skip the unique indexes when SYSCS_UPDATE_STATISTICS is called. <br/>

is the cardinality of a unique index 1 or is it row count? </p>

<p>It is also more complicated than just skipping unique indexes, it depends on the number of columns in the index because <br/>
in a multi-column index, multiple cardinalities are calculated. So for instance on an index on columns A,B,C there are <br/>
actually 3 cardinalities calculated: <br/>
A <br/>
A,B <br/>
A,B,C </p>

<p>I agree that the calculation of cardinality of A,B,C could/should be short circuited for a unique index. <br/>

Mike, <br/>
It looks to me as if the cardinality is the number of unique values, so I think the cardinality of a unique index is equal to its row count (for the full key, that is). You re right that we can t short circuit it if we have a multi-column index. I don t know if it s worth the extra complexity to short circuit the A,B,C case, since we d have to scan the entire index anyway. For a single-column unique index it sounds like a good idea, though. <br/>
