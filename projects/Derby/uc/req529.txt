[DERBY-5896] Change java/drda source code to use  spaces instead of tabs and clean up tab creep in java/client <p>Change all the network server code under java/drda to use spaces instead of tabs.</p>

<p>Having mixed tabs and spaces can be confusing, irritating  and time consuming for developers especially in the network code where client is all spaces and the server mostly tabs.</p>

<p>With the  -x -b options on svn merge and svn diff, merges should be reasonable even if we change all the tabs to 4 spaces in the files under java/drda with a script something like (not yet tried):</p>

<p>#!/bin/bash<br/>
files=$@<br/>
for file in $files</p>
{
   echo $file
   mv  $file $file.orig
   sed -e  s/\t/    /g  &lt; $file.orig &gt; $file
   rm $file.orig
}


<p>Are there any objections to this change?  If not does anyone have any pending DRDA changes they would like to get in before I make the change?</p>
