[DERBY-1700] Remove passing of closeCleanup method to every ResultSet type since only the top ResultSet requires it. <p>A UNION node will generate byte code to call this method:</p>

<p>NoPutResultSet getUnionResultSet(NoPutResultSet source1,<br/>
NoPutResultSet source2,<br/>
Activation activation,<br/>
int resultSetNumber,<br/>
double optimizerEstimatedRowCount,<br/>
double optimizerEstimatedCost,<br/>
GeneratedMethod closeCleanup)</p>

<p>The closeCleanup method is passed in as null for all result sets in a tree except the top one. Instead of passing it on each new result set, it would be much more efficient to have a setCloseMethod() that is only called once for the top result set.  Could also look at having an closeCleanup method in the interface and call it directly, rather than through reflection.</p>

<p>This applies to any node that takes a closeCleanup method.</p>
