[DERBY-5080] Utilize JQL to fetch JIRA issue list for release notes generation <p><a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-4857  title= Utilize the SOAP API to fetch JIRA issue list for release notes generation  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-4857 ><del>DERBY-4857</del></a> made it possible to use the JIRA SOAP API to fetch a list of issues fixed in a release. However, the release manager have to manually create a JIRA filter and feed the filter id to the tool.<br/>
Now that the Apache JIRA instance has been updated to 4.x, we can use the JIRA Query Language (JQL) to avoid that manual step.</p>
