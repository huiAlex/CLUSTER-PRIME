[DERBY-1313] SUR: Use DRDA s extended diagnostic to send ROW_UPDATED and ROW_DELETED warnings. <p>Detectability of own changes is implemented in the client using warnings cf the write-up for <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-775  title= Network client: Add support for scrollable, updatable, insensitive result sets  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-775 ><del>DERBY-775</del></a>. When a row has been deleted and/or updated, a warning will be sent to the client to indicate that fact. Presently, only one warning can be sent each time a data row is sent from to the client, that means that some warnings may be lost. Using extended diagnostic allows us to send several warnings for each data row.</p>

<p>I propose to use extended diagnostics to send ROW_UPDATED and ROW_DELETED warnings when necessary. This may later be extended for other warnings, but I do not plan to do it as a part of the work in this issue.</p>
