[DERBY-3371] Strange (and untested) code fragment in RAMTransaction.addColumnToConglomerate()  <p>RAMTransaction.addColumnToConglomerate() contains this piece of code:</p>

<p>            // remove old entry in the Conglomerate directory, and add new one<br/>
			if (tempCongloms != null)<br/>
				tempCongloms.remove(new Long(conglomId));<br/>
			tempCongloms.put(new Long(conglomId), conglom);</p>

<p>1. According to the code coverage report (<a href= http://people.apache.org/~fuzzylogic/codecoverage/529822/_files/3fc.html#5  class= external-link  rel= nofollow >http://people.apache.org/~fuzzylogic/codecoverage/529822/_files/3fc.html#5</a>) these lines are not tested. If possible, a test that covers them should be added to the regression suite.</p>

<p>2. The null check looks either unnecessary (seems to be the case after a brief inspection of the code), or incomplete since the last line will throw a NullPointerException regardless of the check if tempCongloms is null.</p>

<p>3. The call to remove() before put() is redundant, since HashMap.put() will remove the old mapping implicitly.</p>

<p>4. It seems to me that the object that is put into the HashMap always is the same as the one that is removed, so perhaps all these lines could be deleted.</p>
