[DERBY-1581] BasicDependencyManager re-loads the Provider multiple times from the DataDictionary when loading the stored dependencies for the Provider. <p>From work on <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-1593  title= Separate test jar files from the &quot;product&quot; jars in a distribution  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-1593 >DERBY-1593</a> &amp; <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-1330  title= Provide runtime privilege checking for grant/revoke functionality  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-1330 ><del>DERBY-1330</del></a>  it was discovered the DependencyMangerImpl  loaded the same Provier multiple times from the DataDictionary while loading the stored dependecies and converting them to an in-memory form.  There is no need to load the Provider from the  DataDictionary because it is passed into the DependencyManger.invalidateFor call that results in the loading of the stored dependencies.</p>
