[DERBY-821] Client driver: Implicitly close exhausted result sets on the server <p>Forward-only result sets that are exhausted should be implicitly<br/>
closed on the server. This way, ResultSet.close() does not have to<br/>
send an explicit close message generating unnecessary network traffic.</p>

<p>The DRDA protocol supports this. From the description of OPNQRY (open<br/>
query):</p>

<p>  The qryclsimp parameter controls whether the target server<br/>
  implicitly closes a non-scrollable query upon end of data (SQLSTATE<br/>
  02000) in association with the cursor type.</p>
