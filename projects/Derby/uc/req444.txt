[DERBY-506] Implement Statement.setQueryTimeout in the Client Driver <p>Currently, the Embedded Driver supports Statement.setQueryTimeout(), but the Client Driver does not. The Client Driver should be enhanced and match the Embedded Driver.</p>

<p>For this, we need to transfer the timeout value from the client to the server, preferably without a separate round-trip. I have some loose thoughts on how to do this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the client has set a timeout value for a statement, prepend the (DRDA) EXCSQLSTT command with an EXCSQLSET command which contains the timeout value; conceptually a  SET STATEMENT TIMEOUT &lt;seconds&gt;  (this does not mean that we need to extend the Derby grammar; only the Network Server needs to understand this DRDA EXCSQLSET command).</li>
	<li>In DRDAConnThread.parseEXCSQLSETobjects() on the server side, recognize the  SET STATEMENT TIMEOUT  text, parse the timeout value and remember it for the coming EXCSQLSTT command. Do NOT invoke executeUpdate() with the SET statement <span class= error >&#91;see note below&#93;</span>.</li>
	<li>In DRDAConnThread.parseEXCSQLSTT(), check if a timeout value has been set; if so, use it (by setting the timeout value on the server-side Statement object before calling execute/executeQuery).</li>
</ul>
