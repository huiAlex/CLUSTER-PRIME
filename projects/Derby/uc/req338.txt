[DERBY-3743] Revoking EXECUTE privilege on a function if used in a CHECK constraint: implementation problem  <p>The docs say that REVOKE EXECUTE ... RESTRICT should <br/>
fail if there is a dependent constraint:</p>

<p> The RESTRICT clause specifies that the EXECUTE privilege cannot be<br/>
 revoked if the specified routine is used in a view, trigger, or<br/>
 constraint, and the privilege is being revoked from the owner of the<br/>
 view, trigger, or constraint. </p>

<p> Revoking the privilege will be correctly restricted, but possibly for the wrong reason.</p>
