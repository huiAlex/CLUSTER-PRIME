[DERBY-737] SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE should create statistics if they do not exist <p>There must be an entry in the SYSSTATISTICS table in order for the cardinality statistics in SYSSTATISTICS to be created with SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE </p>

<p>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE  should create statistics if they don t exist.  The only way to create them if the index was created on an empty table, seems to be to drop and recreate the index after the table has been loaded.</p>


<p>The documentation will also need updating if this change is made.<br/>
