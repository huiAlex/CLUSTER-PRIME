[DERBY-2466] Allow dynamic reloading of the security policy file  <p>The spec attached to <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-2109  title= System privileges  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-2109 >DERBY-2109</a> describes how to allow the policy file to be dynamically reloaded while a server is running: We add a getPolicy permission to the Basic policy and we add a DBA-owned system procedure, SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_REFRESH_SECURITY_POLICY(), which reloads the policy file. This JIRA tracks that work.</p>
