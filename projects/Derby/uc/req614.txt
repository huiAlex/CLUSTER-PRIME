[DERBY-6825] Add basic JSON support to Derby. <p>Other database are adding support for the popular JSON data interchange format defined by <a href= https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt  class= external-link  rel= nofollow >https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt</a>. We could add a VTI to Derby which would unpack a JSON document into a set of rows. We could also add a reverse transformation, which turns a query result into a JSON document.</p>
