[DERBY-2196] Run standalone network server with security manager by default  <p>From an e-mail discussion:<br/>
... Derby should match the security  provided by typical client server systems such as DB2, Oracle, etc. I <br/>
think in this case system/database owners are trusting the database <br/>
system to ensure that their system cannot be attacked. So maybe if Derby <br/>
is booted as a standalone server with no security manager involved, it <br/>
should install one with a default security policy. Thus allowing Derby <br/>
to use Java security manager to manage system privileges but not <br/>
requiring everyone to become familiar with them.</p>

<p>I imagine such a policy would allow any access to databases under derby.system.home and/or user.home.<br/>
By standalone I mean the network server was started though the main() method (command line).</p>
