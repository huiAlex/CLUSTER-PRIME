[DERBY-4589] Corrupted database prevents startup and should be automatically repaired perhaps <p>I have found a database in my application that prevents startup due to it being corrupted. <br/>
The driver reports that the database does not exist, even though it does. Then when my app tries to create the database using ;create=true; on the URL it fails.</p>

<p>I think this happened due to the app being killed in Task Manager while it was creating the database.</p>

<p>I have the database saved so that you can reproduce the problem. (I m not sure if I can attach it yet)</p>
