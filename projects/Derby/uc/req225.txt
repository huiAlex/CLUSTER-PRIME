[DERBY-2369] NetworkServerControl.shutdown() takes at least 1.5 seconds, could be faster. <p>The shutdown command takes at least 1.5 seconds, broken into two parts:</p>

<ul class= alternate  type= square >
	<li>0.5 seconds is the first sleep after the shutdown request and before the first ping to see if the server is shutdown.</li>
</ul>


<ul class= alternate  type= square >
	<li>~1 second is the time trying to obtain a socket in order to perform the ping to see if the server is shutdown. This socket creation fails (correctly) but takes time to do so.</li>
</ul>


<p>The socket creation time can be avoided by re-using the socket that was used to send the shutdown request.</p>

<p>The sleep time could be reduced by sleeping on a finer granularity, 0.5secs is a long time for a modern processor.</p>
