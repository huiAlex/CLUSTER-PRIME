[DERBY-1926] Provide documentation for ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN <p>The documentation will need to be updated after <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-1489  title= Provide ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN functionality  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-1489 ><del>DERBY-1489</del></a> is committed. The reference manual will need to describe how to use the new ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN feature to drop a column from a table.</p>

<p>The documentation for the ALTER TABLE command is becoming somewhat unwieldy, so perhaps there is a way to restructure the page to make it easier and more approachable.</p>

<p>In the documentation, it will be important to clearly describe the RESTRICT and CASCADE behaviors, as users may be confused by what things cause RESTRICT to refuse to drop a column. The comments in AlterTableConstantAction.java may help.</p>

<p>Specifically, the documentation should note these possibly unexpected behaviors:</p>
<ul class= alternate  type= square >
	<li>If a column is present in one or more indexes, these indexes by themselves do not cause<br/>
   RESTRICT to refuse to drop a column. Instead, the column will simply be dropped from<br/>
   the index, and if that was the last column in that index, the entire index will be dropped.</li>
	<li>Explicitly named CHECK constraints will cause RESTRICT to refuse to drop a column, as<br/>
   will PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, and UNIQUE constrants. However, an unnamed simple<br/>
   NOT NULL constraint on a column will NOT cause RESTRICT to refuse to drop it.</li>
</ul>
