[DERBY-171] Need Correlation ID in UPDATE/DELETE statements <p>You currently can t use a correlation ID in an UPDATE/DELETE statement. This makes it cumbersome to do the following:</p>

<p>UPDATE EMPLOYEE_BONUS<br/>
  SET BONUS = (SELECT SUM(BONUSES.BONUS) FROM BONUSES WHERE <br/>
          EMPLOYEE_BONUS.EMPL_ID = BONUSES.EMPL_ID);</p>

<p>The use of a correlation ID makes this easier to code.</p>

<p>UPDATE EMPLOYEE E<br/>
  SET BONUS = (SELECT SUM(B.BONUS) FROM BONUSES B WHERE B.EMPL_ID = E.EMPL_ID);</p>

<p>This is particularly important if you get carried away with long SCHEMA and TABLE names!</p>
