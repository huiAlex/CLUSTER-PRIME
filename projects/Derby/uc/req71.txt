[DERBY-5363] Tighten permissions of DB files to owner with >= JDK7  <p>Before Java 6, files created by Derby would have the default<br/>
permissions of the operating system context. Under Unix, this would<br/>
depend on the effective umask of the process that started the Java VM.</p>

<p>In Java 6 and 7, there are methods available that allows tightening up this<br/>
(File.setReadable, setWritable), making it less likely that somebody<br/>
would accidentally run Derby with a too lenient default.</p>

<p>I suggest we take advantage of this, and let Derby by default (in Java<br/>
6 and higher) limit the visibility to the OS user that starts the VM,<br/>
e.g. on Unix this would be equivalent to running with umask 0077. More<br/>
secure by default is good, I think.</p>

<p>We could have a flag, e.g.  derby.storage.useDefaultFilePermissions <br/>
that when set to true, would give the old behavior.</p>
