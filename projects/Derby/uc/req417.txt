[DERBY-4588] Provide a diagnostic property that will print a stack trace on successful boot to help diagnose dual boot issues after the DERBY-700 fix <p>Now that <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-700  title= Derby does not prevent dual boot of database from different classloaders on Linux and Mac OS X  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-700 ><del>DERBY-700</del></a> has been fixed, some users upgrading to the 1.6 JVM are seeing an error on dual boot where they did not before (which is of course is a very good thing).  They  do however at that time need to diagnose where the dual boot is coming from which is sometimes harder than one might think with a complex system and legacy code.  It would be helpful to have a property that they could set which would print a stack trace on any boot attempt, even if successful,  to help diagnose the application error, maybe:</p>

<p>derby.stream.error.logBootTrace=true</p>
