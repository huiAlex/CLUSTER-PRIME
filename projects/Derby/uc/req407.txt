[DERBY-4478] Use AtomicLong for XactFactory.tranId <p>Dyre Tjeldvoll posted some results on <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-3092  title= Use java.util.concurrent in TransactionTable to improve scalability  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-3092 ><del>DERBY-3092</del></a> that indicated that some types of load might cause contention on XactFactory.tranId (a shared long), and suggested that it was replaced with a java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong on the platforms that support java.util.concurrent.*.</p>

<p>I m splitting this issue out from <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-3092  title= Use java.util.concurrent in TransactionTable to improve scalability  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-3092 ><del>DERBY-3092</del></a> so that the two possible improvements reported there can be addressed independently.</p>
