[DERBY-4805] Increase the length of the RDBNAM field in the DRDA implementation <p>Currently, whenever the client driver is used, there is a limit of 255 bytes for the database name. This is defined by the DRDA spec and there has been a discussion on the list <span class= error >&#91;1&#93;</span>/<span class= error >&#91;2&#93;</span> as to whether this limit should be raised due to the introduction of the new ACR that allows for UTF-8 characters.</p>

<p>UTF-8 characters can take up to four bytes and this reduces the limit in characters dramatically.</p>

<p>This should be an easy change as there is a codepoint that defines this limit.</p>
