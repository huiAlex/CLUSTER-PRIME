[DERBY-5196] Correct the layout of log.ctrl as described on the Derby web site <p>The Derby web site describes the layout of the log control file, log.ctrl, here: <a href= http://db.apache.org/derby/papers/logformats.html#Format+of+Log+Control+File  class= external-link  rel= nofollow >http://db.apache.org/derby/papers/logformats.html#Format+of+Log+Control+File</a> This description does not agree with the format actually produced by LogToFile.writeControlFile(). That format can be examined using the ControlFileReader tool attached to <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-5195  title= Create tools for browsing the files in the database log directory.  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-5195 >DERBY-5195</a>. The description on the web site should be corrected.</p>
