[DERBY-6287] Don t use reflection to call Java 6 methods in FileUtil <p>The FileUtil class uses reflection to call the following java.io.File methods:</p>

<p>  setWritable(boolean, boolean)<br/>
  setReadable(boolean, boolean)<br/>
  setExecutable(boolean, boolean)</p>

<p>Reflection was used because the methods were introduced in Java 6, and the code had to run on older platforms. Now Java 6 is the lowest supported platform, so we can call the methods directly.</p>
