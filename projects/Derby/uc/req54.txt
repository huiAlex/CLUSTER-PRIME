[DERBY-4208] Parameters ? with OFFSET and/or FETCH  <p>The new OFFSET/FETCH syntax does not support Parameters. </p>

<p>From ij against the toursdb I would like to do the following:</p>

<p>    ij&gt; prepare foo as  select * from cities offset ? rows fetch first 10 rows only ;</p>

<p>but results in the following syntax error: </p>

<p>    ERROR 42X01: Syntax error: Encountered  ?  at line 1, column 29.</p>

<p>Parameterized OFFSET/FETCH is important for performance (can be prepared) and security (SQL strings not created on the fly).</p>
