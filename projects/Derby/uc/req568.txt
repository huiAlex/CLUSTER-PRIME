[DERBY-6320] Log a page dump to derby.log if ERROR nospc: nospc.U  is returned to the user <p>ERROR nospc: nospc.U  should only be an internal error that is caught and handled.  If returned to the user, it is likely a bug. It would be useful if this occurs to have a page dump printed to derby.log.  Care should be taken to only do this if the error is returned to the user and not for the internal variety.</p>
