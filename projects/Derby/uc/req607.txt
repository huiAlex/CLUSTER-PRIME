[DERBY-6674] Cleanup brittle code in ValidateCheckConstraintResultSet <p>The getNextRowCore() method of ValidateCheckConstraintResultSet is an almost exact cut-and-paste copy of the method it overrides in its superclass.

This was discovered while investigating <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-6665  title= Violation of deferred constraints not detected when conglomerates are erroneously shared  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-6665 ><del>DERBY-6665</del></a>.</p>
