[DERBY-4066] Allow functions/procedures to take Blob/Clob arguments <p>Derby objects if you try to declare a function or procedure with an argument whose type is BLOB or CLOB. These kinds of arguments are allowed in the SQL standard and the matching Java types are java.sql.Blob and java.sql.Clob. See the SignatureMatching.html summary attached to <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-3652  title= Derby does not follow the SQL Standard when trying to map SQL routines to Java methods.  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-3652 ><del>DERBY-3652</del></a>.</p>

<p>We should lift this restriction and allow functions and procedures to take large object arguments.</p>
