[DERBY-1938] Add support for setObject(<arg>, null) <p>Derby presently does not implement support for the method<br/>
PreparedStatement.setObject (and similarly for CallableStatement.setObject) <br/>
when the supplied value is null, unless a type argument (3rd arg) is also present. <br/>
That is, in:<br/>
    void setObject(int parameterIndex,<br/>
                              Object x)<br/>
                              throws SQLException<br/>
x can not be null. </p>

<p>Derby will presently throw an SQLException (client: XJ021, embedded: 22005)<br/>
if x is null when calling this method on a preparedStatement.</p>

<p>Porting some applications may be made easier if this restriction is lifted.<br/>
