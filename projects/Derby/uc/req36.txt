[DERBY-6773] Derby throws plain SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException  <p>If a unique constraint is violated by an insert statement, then Derby throws an SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException. The error message contains, in particular, the constraint name and the table name.</p>

<p>To distinguish between cases with various constraints, Derby should instead throw a subclass of SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException, with methods like getConstraintName(), and getTableName().</p>
