[DERBY-1704] Allow more concurrency in the lock manager  <p>I have seen indications of severe monitor contention in SinglePool<br/>
(the current lock manager) when multiple threads access a Derby<br/>
database concurrently. When a thread wants to lock an object, it needs<br/>
to obtain the monitor for both SinglePool and LockSet (both of them<br/>
are global synchronization points). This leads to poor scalability.</p>

<p>We should investigate how to allow more concurrency in the lock<br/>
manager, and either extend SinglePool or implement a new manager.</p>
