[DERBY-3907] Save useful length information for Clobs in store <p>The store should save useful length information for Clobs. This allows the length to be found without decoding the whole data stream.<br/>
The following thread raised the issue on what information to store, and also contains some background information: <a href= http://www.nabble.com/Storing-length-information-for-CLOB-on-disk-tp19197535p19197535.html  class= external-link  rel= nofollow >http://www.nabble.com/Storing-length-information-for-CLOB-on-disk-tp19197535p19197535.html</a></p>

<p>The information to store, and the exact format of it, is still to be discussed/determined.<br/>
Currently two bytes are set aside for length information, which is inadequate.</p>
