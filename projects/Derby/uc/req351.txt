[DERBY-3783] LOBStreamControl shouldn t throw SQLException <p>LOBStreamControl throws three types of exceptions: IOException, SQLException and StandardException.<br/>
All the SQLException are generated/thrown from the code in LOBStreamControl.<br/>
At this level of the code, SQLException should not be thrown, as it is more tedious to handle both SQLException and StandardException at higher levels.</p>


<p>I propose to replace SQLException with StandardException in LOBStreamControl. The purpose of this change is consistency, and also results it slightly less code at higher levels.</p>
