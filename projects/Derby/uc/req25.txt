[DERBY-3934] Improve performance of reading modified Clobs  <p>The performance of reading modified Clobs is poor, which is demonstrated by running a test program selecting a 10 MB Clob and then getting the contents using getSubString:</p>
<ul class= alternate  type= square >
	<li>unmodified Clob (StoreStreamClob) : ~1 300 ms</li>
	<li>modified Clob (TemporaryClob): ~156 000 ms</li>
</ul>


<p>In this case, the Clob was modified by changing the first character.</p>

<p>A number of subtasks will be created to handle the various issues, which will be related to both performance and code cleanup.<br/>
