[DERBY-3213] SQLChar.trim method is unused and could be removed <p>As part of researching <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-2352  title= Assertion Failure with order by and group by expression  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-2352 ><del>DERBY-2352</del></a>, I came to the conclusion that<br/>
the trim() method in SQLChar.java is no longer used, and could be<br/>
removed. It appears that all calls to this method have been switched<br/>
to call ansiTrim() instead.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this just requires removing the code from SQLChar.java<br/>
and StringDataValue.java, and running all the tests to verify that<br/>
nothing is broken.</p>
