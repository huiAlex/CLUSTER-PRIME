[DERBY-3494] Move the setup of NormalizeResultSetNode into the NormalizeResultSetNode <p>In <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-3310  title= ASSERT in MergeSort.checkColumnTypes() disallow legal type conversions  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-3310 ><del>DERBY-3310</del></a> Dan suggested ...</p>

<p>Setting up a NormalizeResultSetNode is spread over three locations, the class itself (very little, it s almost acting like a C struct),<br/>
the genNormalizeResultSetNode method and then copyLengthsAndTypesToSource. A good O-O implementation would have<br/>
the logic to create a NormalizeResultSetNode self-contained in NormalizeResultSetNode.</p>

<p>Since the ResultColumnList of the original ResultSetNode correctly describes the desired outcome, it s not clear to<br/>
me why NormalizeResultSetNode can t just refer to the same list and use it for its processing. They may be some chance<br/>
that this would cause recursion at some point, where a NormalizeResultSetNode would think it needed to be wrapped<br/>
in a NormalizeResultSetNode since the types of its columns and expression don t match (i.e. when it is handled as a regular ResultSetNode).</p>

<p>I think moving the setup of a NormalizeResultSetNode into the class itself, so that its inputs are just the ResultSetNode to wrap<br/>
would help clear up the code, especially if comments were added indicating why certain actions were being taken.</p>

<p>I am separating this task out into a separate issue, so that it can be worked on independently of <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-3310  title= ASSERT in MergeSort.checkColumnTypes() disallow legal type conversions  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-3310 ><del>DERBY-3310</del></a>.</p>
