[DERBY-959] Allow use of DRDA QRYDTA block sizes greater than 32K <p>Currently, the Network Server and Network Client use a 32K blocksize when<br/>
returning database data in QRYDTA blocks.</p>

<p>I came across the following statement in the DRDA spec (Volume 1, page 12):</p>

<p>    Blocking applies only to the QRYDTA reply objects. Each<br/>
    query block is a QRYDTA DSS. The maximum query block size<br/>
    value allowed in the qryblksz parameter is increased from<br/>
    32K to 10M, thus accomodating the larger data volumes<br/>
    required by modern, more data-intensive applications.</p>

<p>The importance of larger block sizes depends strong on the application<br/>
profile.. For example, many applications perform single-record selects, <br/>
and they are not influenced by the block size.</p>

<p>But for some applications, it seems like the ability to use a larger block<br/>
size could be quite valuable.</p>
