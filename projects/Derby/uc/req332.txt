[DERBY-3726] Don t call RAFContainer.padFile() from instances of RAFContainer4 <p>In this thread on derby-dev, <a href= http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/db-derby-dev/200806.mbox/%3c48530848.3020501@sbcglobal.net%3e  class= external-link  rel= nofollow >http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/db-derby-dev/200806.mbox/%3c48530848.3020501@sbcglobal.net%3e</a>,<br/>
it was mentioned that RAFContainer4 calls padFile() when creating a container. Since padFile() uses old I/O calls and the rest of RAFContainer4 uses NIO, it could possibly cause similar issues as those seen in <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-3347  title= ERROR XSDB3: Container information cannot change once written  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-3347 ><del>DERBY-3347</del></a>. Although we haven t verified that this is a problem, we should try to avoid mixing old I/O and NIO to be on the safe side.</p>
