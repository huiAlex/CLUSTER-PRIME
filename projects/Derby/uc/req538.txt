[DERBY-6000] Implement support for JDBC 4.2 <p>Open JDK 8 will include maintenance rev 4.2 of JDBC. The public discussion of JDBC 4.2 will take place here: <a href= http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/170  class= external-link  rel= nofollow >http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/170</a>. We will want to build Derby support for JDBC 4.2 after a public spec appears. At this time, it is unclear what Derby release will carry this support.</p>
