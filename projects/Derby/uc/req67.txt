[DERBY-212] Optimize some specific methods in Network Server to improve performance  <p>In reviewing the Network Server Code and profiling there were <br/>
several areas that showed potential for providing performance <br/>
improvement.</p>

<p>Functions that need optimizing to prevent unneeded object <br/>
creation and excessive decoding<br/>
parsePKGNAMCSN()<br/>
parseSQLDTA_work()<br/>
buildDB2CursorName()</p>


<p>In DDMWriter and DDMReader, use System Routines in <br/>
java.util.Arrays and System.arrayCopy instead of <br/>
writing code to do functions like copy arrays and <br/>
pad strings.</p>
