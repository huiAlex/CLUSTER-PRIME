[DERBY-6642] Make the JUnit result set assertion methods dump the actual rs when assertion fails <p>Often, when researching intermittent regression test errors, an assertion on a result set fails, but the error report only shows which column in which row first fails to meet expectations. It would be good if the assertion methods could dump the actual result set in such cases so we d have more information to go on when trying to understand the cause of the problem.</p>
