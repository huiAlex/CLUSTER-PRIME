[DERBY-6672] Allow Derby to rename tables referenced by foreign keys  <p>Hi, I m on the Apache Roller team and we use database migration scripts to update databases between Roller releases.  (We have a common template (<a href= http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/roller/trunk/app/src/main/resources/sql/500-to-510-migration.vm?view=co  class= external-link  rel= nofollow >http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/roller/trunk/app/src/main/resources/sql/500-to-510-migration.vm?view=co</a>)  that is run through Velocity to create specific scripts for the several databases that we support.)  One handicap with Derby that we re not seeing with other databases is its inability to rename tables that have FK s on them.  Renaming one of our tables returns this error from Derby:</p>

<p>This results in the migration scripts needing to be messy, first dropping all constraints before recreating them, for the one RDBMS that requires it.  It would be great if a future release of Derby could be coded to support table renames regardless of the constraints defined on it.  Thanks!</p>
