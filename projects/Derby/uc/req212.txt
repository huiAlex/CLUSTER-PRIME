[DERBY-2242] Convert jdbcapi/metadata.java to JUnit test. <p>Create a test for DatabaseMetaData that matches the testing of metadata.java.<br/>
Should also handle the odbc_metadata variant.</p>

<p>Once created can be used by other tests to ensure database meta data works in other situations, such as upgrade and read-only databases.</p>
