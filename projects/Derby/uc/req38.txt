[DERBY-515] Network Server should log server start and shutdown time to derby.log  <p>Network server currently only reports the start and stop of network server to the console output and does not print an associated timestamp.</p>

<p>It would be helpful if the start and stop times of network server  were recorded in the derby.log, so there would not be a need to check t the  console output.</p>
