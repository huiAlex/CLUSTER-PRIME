[DERBY-690] Add scrollable, updatable, insensitive result sets [DERBY-775] Network client: Add support for scrollable, updatable, insensitive result sets  <p>JDBC result sets are created with three properties: type, concurrency<br/>
and holdability. The type can be one of TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY,<br/>
TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE and TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE. The concurrency can<br/>
be one of CONCUR_READ_ONLY and CONCUR_UPDATABLE. The holdability can<br/>
be one of HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT and CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT.</p>

<p>JDBC allows the full cross product of these. SQL 2003 prohibits the<br/>
combination </p>
{TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, CONCUR_UPDATABLE}
<p>, but this<br/>
combination is supported by some vendors, notably Oracle.</p>

<p>Currently, Derby supports JDBC result sets in a limited<br/>
way. Holdability is supported. Furthermore, the following is<br/>
supported: </p>
<ul class= alternate  type= square >
	<li>forward-only, read-only</li>
	<li>forward-only, updatable (update, delete, but not insert)<br/>
	     Also, in the network driver, support for some data types<br/>
	     conversions is missing.</li>
	<li>scroll insensitive, read-only</li>
</ul>


<p>We (Fernanda and Andreas will cooperate with me on this) propose a<br/>
plan to add support for the combination:</p>

<ul class= alternate  type= square >
	<li>scroll insensitive, updatable</li>
</ul>


<p>for both the embedded driver and the network client driver. <br/>
As a part of this we would also like to add the missing insert<br/>
operation to the </p>
{forward-only, updatable}
<p> result sets (JIRA-100), and<br/>
remove the requirement for an explicit  FOR UPDATE  clause in the SQL<br/>
query to achieve updatability if CONCUR_UPDATABLE is specified<br/>
(JIRA-231).</p>

<p>The full proposal text is uploaded as an attachment, including a proposed<br/>
functional specification.</p>

<p>This JIRA will  be used to track sub-issues for this effort. The sub-issues will be linked back to this issue.</p>
