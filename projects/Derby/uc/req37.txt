[DERBY-4789] Always apply the bulk-insert optimization when inserting from a table function.  <p>Inserting from a table function is a lot like importing from a file:</p>

<p>1) Derby has limited visibility into the size of the external data source.</p>

<p>2) The user is often trying to import a large data set.</p>

<p>The import procedures assume that Derby should always apply the bulk-insert optimization when importing from a file. The same assumption seems reasonable whenever a table function appears in the source stream of an INSERT.</p>
