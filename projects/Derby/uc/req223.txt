[DERBY-2356] Make SSL server authentication optional <p>Default SSL behaviour is to require serer authentication. For a database application this is not as important as it is for web browsers and also creates som extra hassle for the user/application programmer. Since the main objective for SSL in Derby is encryption on the wire, server authentication should be optional (the same way client authentication is).</p>

<p>This also creates some symmetry which can be exploited to simplify the user interfce somewhat.
