[DERBY-5210] Use java.nio.ByteBuffer in client.net.Request <p>We should see if we could use a java.nio.ByteBuffer instead of a byte array in org.apache.derby.client.net.Request, similar to what we did for DDMWriter in <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-2936  title= Use java.nio.ByteBuffer for buffering in DDMWriter  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-2936 ><del>DERBY-2936</del></a>. ByteBuffer provides some helper methods that allows us to simplify the code that puts multi-byte values into the buffer (like ByteBuffer.putShort(), putInt(), putLong()). It may also be a first step on the way to using a CharsetEncoder to encode strings without going via an intermediate throw-away byte array (see <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-5068  title= Investigate increased CPU usage on client after introduction of UTF-8 CcsidManager  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-5068 ><del>DERBY-5068</del></a> for details).</p>
