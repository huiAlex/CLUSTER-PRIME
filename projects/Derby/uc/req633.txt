[DERBY-888] improve performance of page allocation <p>Improve performance of page allocation by no longer requiring sync of the allocated pages.  The reason for the sync<br/>
currently is so that during redo recovery we did not have to handle the case of redoing the allocate and finding no space<br/>
available on the disk.   During tasks like single user load this sync allocation is a significant performance issue - in the<br/>
case where one does 1000 insert per transaction the total time aproaches very close to durability=test where no syncing<br/>
is done in the whole system.</p>

<p>For instance in a test of loading a 150 meg db with a number of tables and indexes, on a 1.7 ghz laptop with one ide disk,<br/>
sun jdk1.4.2, windows XP<br/>
i got the following types of results:<br/>
default system:  6 minutes<br/>
no alloc sync:      1 minute, 43 seconds<br/>
no syncing:          1 minute , 1 second</p>

<p>Once syncing is disabled then recovery must be enhanced to handle the possible out of space condition.  Recovery already<br/>
handles out of space during undo, so this will just handle the error the same as that.  It will stop recovery and produce an error<br/>
indicating that user must add disk space and rerun recovery before system can be brought online.  I actually think on most<br/>
JVM s/OS s this won t happen as the system will still be asking the JVM/OS for the space, just not syncing the values in those<br/>
pages to disk.  Most OS s at this point will reserve the space in the file tables and not let others grab that space.  </p>

<p>This project will make sure that out of space recovery path has tests.  It will also make sure that redo recovery encountering garbage<br/>
in a newly allocated page during redo of an create page is tested.</p>
