[DERBY-4115] Provide a way to drop statistics information  <p>Now that <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-269  title= Provide some way to update index cardinality statistics (e.g. reimplement update statistics)  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-269 ><del>DERBY-269</del></a> has been resolved,  users can update statistics, but once they do, they are committed to using and maintaining the statistics, even if it doesn t improve performance or they have difficulty maintaining the statistics on a regular basis.  It would be good to have a way to drop statistics information so that users could revert to the prior behavior if needed.</p>
