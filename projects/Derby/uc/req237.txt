[DERBY-2472] Use Throwable.initCause() to improve error reporting <p>As Derby has moved to J2SE 1.4, Throwable.initCause() can now be used to improve error reporting.<br/>
As stated in the initial commit (that was backed out, see below):<br/>
 Set Throwable.initCause() in a couple of locations at the JDBC level where we setup nested SQLExceptions.<br/>
This means that automatically the stack trace for a database failed to start includes the reason<br/>
for the failure, rather than just  see next exception . This is a great help when running<br/>
JUnit tests and getting failures to start a database. </p>

<p>The initial commit was backed out because it broke numerous tests under JDK 1.6, and the author indicated he had no time to investigate.<br/>
The patch caused no failures when running the tests with Java SE 5.0.</p>
