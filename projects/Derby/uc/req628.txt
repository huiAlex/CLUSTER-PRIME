[DERBY-818] Read-only embedded ResultSets incur performance penalty due to updateable ResultSet code. <p>The fields columnGotUpdated and copyOfDatabaseRow are allocated and maintained in EmbedResultSet for every ResultSet but they are only required if the result set is updateable. I saw a 5% improvement in execution rate on a simple VALUES clause when fixing this.</p>
