[DERBY-2911] Implement a buffer manager using java.util.concurrent classes <p>There are indications that the buffer manager is a bottleneck for some types of multi-user load. For instance, Anders Morken wrote this in a comment on <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-1704  title= Allow more concurrency in the lock manager  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-1704 ><del>DERBY-1704</del></a>:  With a separate table and index for each thread (to remove latch contention and lock waits from the equation) we (...) found that org.apache.derby.impl.services.cache.Clock.find()/release() caused about 5 times more contention than the synchronization in LockSet.lockObject() and LockSet.unlock(). That might be an indicator of where to apply the next push .</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see the scalability and performance of a buffer manager which exploits the concurrency utilities added in Java SE 5.</p>
