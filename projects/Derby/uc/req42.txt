[DERBY-4551] Allow database user to execute stored procedures with same permissions as database owner and/or routine definer  <p>Curretnly there is no way to hide data and database structure in embedded derby from the end user. </p>

<p>One way to accomplish the above requirement is as follows:<br/>
1. Create encrypted database so data is protected<br/>
2. Enable authentication and sql authorization in database<br/>
3. Create two users, dbUser and dbOwner<br/>
4. Store application logic as stored procedure in the databse so dbUser does not know what tables are accecced by the application logic, thus hiding table structure<br/>
5. Revoke select permission from dbUser so he cannot describe tables thus protecting table structures<br/>
6. Give only Execute permissions on stored procedures to dbUser</p>

<p>The above steps will ensure that data and data structure is hidden when application is delivered to end user.</p>

<p>The problem is, if user does not have select permission, the stored procedures will not execute. So I am requesting the following enhancement to Derby:</p>

<p>If dbOwner has given Execure permission to stored procecure to a dbUser, then allow stored procedure to execute even if the dbUser has no select permission. </p>

<p>In otherwords, When dbUser calls stored procedure, database will use dbOwners authorization to execute stored procedure rather than dbUsers.  </p>

<p>This may be implemented by creating new permission called RunAsDbOwner.</p>

<p>DbOwner can then grant permission to dbUser  to execute a stored procedure with RunAsDbOwner.</p>

<p>If this is implemented, applications can be created which will truely hide the database structure and data from end users. Database will behave as a blackbox with only in/out data exposed in stored procedures.</p>
