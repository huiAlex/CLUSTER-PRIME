[DERBY-3703] Make it possible to build the JSR169 support with the jdk1.4 libraries <p>It would be good to simplify the Derby build so that the whole product could be built out-of-the-box just from what s checked into the Derby repository. As a step toward this goal, it would be good to be able to build the jsr169 support without having to download proprietary libraries.</p>
