[DERBY-2557] Provide a new interface on DataValueFactory(DVF) called getNull(formatId, collationType) which returns a DVD with proper collation association.  <p>Provide a new interface, called getInstanceUsingFormatIdAndCollationType(formatId, collationType) on DVF. Store will call this interface to create empty DVD objects and then load these DVD objects using readExternal. For performance efficiency, when Store needs more of the same base DVD, then on subsequent needs, it will call DVD.getNewNull rather than calling DVF.getInstanceUsingFormatIdAndCollationType again. This work is required for <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-2537  title= implement pushing collation info to store, storing collation info in store metadata, and creating templates based on store metadata  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-2537 ><del>DERBY-2537</del></a>.</p>
