[DERBY-688] Enhancements to XML functionality to move toward XPath/XQuery support... <p>As of <a href= https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-334  title= Add initial SQL support for XML datatype/functions in Derby,  based on SQL/XML specs.  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= DERBY-334 ><del>DERBY-334</del></a>, Derby has some very basic support for XML that consists of an XML datatype and three operators (XMLPARSE, XMLSERIALIZE, and XMLEXISTS).  I would like to enhance this existing functionality and, by doing so, help to move Derby incrementally toward a more usable and more complete XPath/XQuery solution (with emphasis on  incrementally ).</p>

<p>I have attached to this issue a document describing the particular changes that I am looking to make.  At a high level, they consist of:</p>

<p>1) Making it easier to use the XML operators and datatype from within JDBC (ex. by implicit parsing/serialization of XML values).</p>

<p>2) Adding a new operator, XMLQUERY, to allow a user to retrieve the results of an XPath expression (instead of just determining whether or not the expression evaluates to an empty sequence, which is what XMLEXISTS does).</p>

<p>3) Making changes to the existing operators to line them up with the SQL/XML 2005 specification, and also to take steps toward my eventual hope of having support for XQuery (as opposed to just XPath) in Derby.</p>

<p>If anyone has time and interest enough to look at the document and provide feedback, that d be great...</p>
