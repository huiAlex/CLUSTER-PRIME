[ISPN-388] Cache view rank on a ViewChange listener for Hot Rod version generation <p>Hot Rod server generates version numbers for cache entries based on the JGroups view id and view rank which is the location of the current server in that view. Currently, this rank is calculated whenever a new version is generated but this is quite wasteful. The view rank could be calculated upon a view change and reused until there s a new view change. This would speed up version generation.</p>
