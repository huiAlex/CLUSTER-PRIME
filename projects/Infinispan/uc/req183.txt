[ISPN-2861] Integrate the CloudTM extended statistics in Infinispan  <p>The extended statistics allows to profile Infinispan. It will be implemented a two separated modules:</p>

<p>The first will give information like, for example, average transaction execution, message sizes, number of operations per transaction, etc.</p>

<p>In addition, the second module will support the called top-key streaming. This technique allows to check which are the most accessed/locked/etc. keys in the application.</p>

<p>I ll made the full list of the current implemented statistics soon.</p>
