[ISPN-271] Expose global information in RpcManagerImpl via CacheManager <p>RpcManagerImpl exposes information that are both global to all caches under a cache manager and information that is specific to a cache.</p>

<p>An idea would be to expose any global information via CacheManager mbean instead, i.e. address, cluster members</p>

<p>And the rest, stuff that is cache specific, expose via rpc manager mbean,</p>
