[ISPN-223] CacheManager needs to identifiable <p>We need CacheManager s to expose some kind of name or id that differenciates them from the rest. <br/>
The jmxDomain is not enough since you could have different machines running different VMs deploying the CacheManager instances with the same jmxDomain and this is valid.</p>

<p>The reason we need this is so that Jopr can show different cache manager s amongst their resources. Currently, it can only show one.</p>
