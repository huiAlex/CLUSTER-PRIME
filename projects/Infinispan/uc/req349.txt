[ISPN-9] Eviction redesign <p>Eviction needs some redesigning:</p>

<p>1.  Eviction based on timed out/unused entries (passivation).  This is not expiration, which removes entries.<br/>
2.  Eviction event queue, eviction algorithm queues wasteful - can we not incorporate additional ordering into the data container and directly prune?</p>
