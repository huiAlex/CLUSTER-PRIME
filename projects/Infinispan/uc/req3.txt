[ISPN-3697] Improved lifecycle control of JGroupsChannelLookup  <p>Currently, a JGroupsChannelLookup can indicate whether the JGroupsTransport should connect the provided channel and disconnect/close the provided channel.<br/>
In the case of Wildfly, we d like to distinguish between disconnect and close.  We have a service that provided the channel, but we allow the JGroupsTransport to manage the lifecycle. This leads to conditions where infinispan s cache manager can restart, but the jgroups channel service does not, e.g.<br/>
<a href= https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-2458  class= external-link  rel= nofollow >https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-2458</a></p>

<p>To fix this, I need to introduce hacks into the channel returned by the channel service, such that Channel.close() is a no-op, and introduce a separate method invisible to Infinispan to perform the actual close().</p>

<p>So what I propose is the following:</p>

<p>boolean shouldConnect();  // Notice that I renamed this, because there is no such distinction between  start  and  connect .</p>

<p>boolean shouldDisconnect();</p>

<p>boolean shouldClose();</p>
