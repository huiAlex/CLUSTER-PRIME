[ISPN-2848] Use the new bundling mechanism from JGroups 3.3.0 <p>See the  Message bundling  as described here: <a href= https://docspace.corp.redhat.com/docs/DOC-134411  class= external-link  rel= nofollow >https://docspace.corp.redhat.com/docs/DOC-134411</a><br/>
It makes sense to remove the DONT_BUNDLE flag entirely: as per <a href= https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=belaban  class= user-hover  rel= belaban >Bela Ban</a> even for a single sync request, the performance with bundling enabled is the same as without bundling. This change should be validated by QA performance wise.</p>
