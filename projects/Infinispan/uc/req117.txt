[ISPN-1666] Add EmbeddedCacheManager.getCacheConfiguration(String) <p>Currently, EmbeddedCacheManager provides no mechanism to retrieve a defined cache configuration without starting the corresponding cache.<br/>
Formerly, one could achieve this via the defineConfiguration(String, Configuration) method, by passing in an empty Configuration object, however, this will not work with the new configuration API - the returned object will always be equivalent the one passed in.</p>
