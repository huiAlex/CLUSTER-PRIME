[ISPN-3051] Allow configuring the number of segments per node  <p>This should allow for the following use cases:</p>
<ul class= alternate  type= square >
	<li>a node to take more load</li>
	<li>a node to take no load</li>
</ul>


<p>A simple way for specifying this would be to configure a load factor per node, e.g. more powerful machine would be 2*x and that would mean that it would take twice the load of an  ordinary  machine in the cluster.</p>
