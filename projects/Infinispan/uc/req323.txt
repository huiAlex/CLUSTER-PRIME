[ISPN-6647] DecoratedCache.putForExternalRead method with Metadata ignores Metadata <p>The implementation of the <tt>putForExternalRead</tt> method ignores the <tt>Metadata</tt> parameter, instead of passing it on to the <tt>putForExternalRead</tt> method in the cache implementation. This is no doubt because the cache implementation previously didn t support <tt>Metadata</tt> for <tt>putForExternalRead</tt>.</p>

<p>I will prepare a PR and attach it to this ticket shortly. It was a gargantuan effort to patch this up, as you ll see!</p>
