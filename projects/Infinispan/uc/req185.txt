[ISPN-292] Implement a stale lock cleanup mechanism <p>Similar to braking stale locks in JBoss Cache.  This is to prevent situations such as:</p>

<p>N1 starts a tx, acquires locks<br/>
N1 prepares<br/>
N2 now acquires necessary locks<br/>
N1 now crashes</p>

<p>locks on N2 should not be held indefinitely, and resources should be released properly.</p>
