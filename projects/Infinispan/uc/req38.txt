[ISPN-161] REST API based on the server module as a back-end [ISPN-171] Build a server module based on the HotRod protocol  <p>Essentially, a module that can be deployed as a REST API to talk to the cache backend.  Possibly something that wraps the cache, making use of libraries such as RESTEasy.</p> <p>Could be based on existing JBoss Remoting components which have the capability to handle load balancing and faoliver.  Needs to share some components with <a href= https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-172  title= Build a Java-based smart client that makes use of the HotRod protocol  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= ISPN-172 ><del>ISPN-172</del></a> so that protocol parsing code isn t repeated.  May also share some components with <a href= https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-173  title= Build memcached server module  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= ISPN-173 ><del>ISPN-173</del></a> so that abstract transport and socket handling code is reused.</p>

<p>Will also need a comprehensive wiki page detailing usage and demonstration.</p>
