[ISPN-256] Enable Infinispan SPIs to implement their own commands <p> Much nicer IMHO would be a nice SPI / plug point to allow applications to extend the set of commands. Let an app create an ExtensionCommand; if that comes in off the channel pass it off to the handler the application registered.</p>

<p>This could for example be used instead of the solution currently used in <a href= http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-3818  class= external-link  rel= nofollow >http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-3818</a>. In HHH-3818, the cache is used as a notification vehicle which is a bit of a hack and has some limitations for example when trying to implement a similar solution for evict(key) op.</p>

<p>Another use case for it would be HTTP session ownership, from Brian Stansberry:</p>

<p>(09:32:09 AM) brian_stansberry: ... it s just that only 1 server at a time s/b able to use a session<br/>
(09:32:25 AM) brian_stansberry: so on failover i send an extension command requesting ownership<br/>
(09:33:19 AM) brian_stansberry: there s actually a servlet spec requirement that only one server at a time access a session<br/>
(09:33:23 AM) brian_stansberry: ejb spec too<br/>
(09:33:37 AM) brian_stansberry: we don t properly handle that<br/>
...<br/>
(09:34:18 AM) brian_stansberry: basically it s a lock<br/>
...<br/>
(09:34:35 AM) brian_stansberry: that s all it is, a distributed lock<br/>
(09:35:03 AM) brian_stansberry: but once you have the distributed lock it s yours until you give it up<br/>
(09:35:29 AM) brian_stansberry: so once 1 request acquires it, subsequent requests to same server can just use a local lock<br/>
...<br/>
(09:41:59 AM) brian_stansberry: the key thing is there should only be a cluster-wide operation once per session<br/>
(09:42:11 AM) brian_stansberry: unless there is failover</p>
