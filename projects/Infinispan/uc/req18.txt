[ISPN-3514] Revamp embedded Infinispan configuration  [ISPN-2655] Make HotRod client always read from the main data owner [ISPN-2643] Configure the Java Hot Rod client to always go to the main data owner when requesting data  <p>Umbrella JIRA for all the configurations-related Infinispan enhancements. </p> <p><a href= https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-2643  title= Configure the Java Hot Rod client to always go to the main data owner when requesting data  class= issue-link  data-issue-key= ISPN-2643 ><del>ISPN-2643</del></a> made the java Hot Rod client always write to the main owner. ATM the client picks a random owner for reading though. This read-load-balancing doesn t really help, as assuming the data is evenly spread, the amount of reads would be distributed uniformly across the cluster. OTOH forcing the client to always read from the main owner would guarantee red-consistency for <b>async</b> replicated caches. Even so read consistency might still be a problem when a node crashed, but still these is a much stronger guarantee and makes async replication usable in many more scenarios.</p> <p>ATM the HR client picks randomly a node owner when it writes data.<br/>
With <a href= https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ISPN-2552  title= Support concurrent updates for non-transactional caches   class= issue-link  data-issue-key= ISPN-2552 ><del>ISPN-2552</del></a> in place, this is suboptimal, as during writes the secondary owner delegates the write to the main owner for lock acquisition, which means an additional RPC. We should make the HR client always write to the main data owner directly.</p>
