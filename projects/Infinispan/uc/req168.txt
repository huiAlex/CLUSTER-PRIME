[ISPN-2464] Allow DistributedExecutorService to control shutdown of given local ExecutorService <p>Constructors that receive a thread pool from clients not shut it down on stop: it s a good rule of resource management for the creator of the resource (thread pool for us) to manage the shutdown as well.<br/>
So here s how I think this can be solved:<br/>
1. Add a new Ctor that besides the pool also has a flag to allow us to take ownership of the pool (i.e. we ll destroy it when the DistExec is shutdow)<br/>
2. leave the current constructor as it is, make it internally invoke 1. with takeOwnership=true (this would preserve backward compatibility)<br/>
3. amend the executor to only shutdown the thread pool if it has ownership<br/>
4. document the threadpool ownership in all constructors</p>
