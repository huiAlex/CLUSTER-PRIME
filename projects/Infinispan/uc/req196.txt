[ISPN-314] Enhance test fwk to report when a resource was not properly cleaned by a test <p> if  a test fails and didn t clean up resources properly (in this case destroy the cache managers) then next test running on the same thread will see the already existing cluster, and blockUntil.. methods will fail.<br/>
Make the fwk report that a cluster is not properly shutdown by a test, when another tries to create a cluster.</p>
