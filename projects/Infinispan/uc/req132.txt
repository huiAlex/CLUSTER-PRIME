[ISPN-186] Smart L1 cache invalidation <p>Need to build a mechanism in which L1 invalidation is NOT multicast, but instead is unicast <em>if necessary</em> to specific nodes that may have cached a given entry.  This can be detected by maintaining a list of nodes who have requested a key via a remote get, but this would need to be relayed by all data owners.</p>

<p>Benefits would be performance by removing unnecessary invalidation where this is not needed, and by reducing noise in network stacks of most nodes.</p>
